This project consists in creating three VMs (master, worker1, worker2) and run some hadoop MapReduce jobs for data manipulation. In an old school way!!! 😎

-- 1. I'm on a MacBook, so I'm  gonna start choosing my hypervisor and installing UTM (it could be VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion Player, or any other hypervisor)
#####
-- 2. Download iso file for Linux https://ubuntu.com/download/server
#####
-- 3. Create 3 VM's, called hadoop-master, hadoop-worker1, hadoop-worker2
VM configs (for each one):
    - CPU: 2vCPUs
    - RAM: 4GB
    - Disk: 20GB
    - Network: NAT
    (Install SSH)
    After linux kernel installation is complete, remove the iso from your hypervisor virtual machines and reboot linux.
#####
-- 4. On terminal (for each VM):
    Get the IP address:
        ip a | grep inet
    (In my case)
        192.168.64.6 <- hadoop-master
        192.168.64.8 <- hadoop-worker1
        192.168.64.7 <- hadoop-worker2

    Open the following file:
        sudo nano /etc/hosts

    Add 3 lines with the 3 IPs and hostnames of each VM:
    192.168.64.6 hadoop-master
    192.168.64.8 hadoop-worker1
    192.168.64.7 hadoop-worker2

    Save the file!
    Verify if your changes are done:
    cat /etc/hosts

    Test connection with the other VMs (from master, but recommended to test in every VM):
    ping hadoop-worker1
    ping hadoop-worker2
#####
-- 5. Keygen on hadoop-master (the VMs need to trust themselves without password):
    ssh-keygen -y rsa -b 4096

    Copy public key to workers:
    ssh-copy-id hadoop-worker1
    ssh-copy-id hadoop-worker2

    Try to access without password:
    ssh hadoop-worker1
    ssh hadoop-worker2
#####
--6. Java! ☕️ (all in each VM)
    Download and install java:
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

    (Verify)
    java --version

    Check java path
    readlink -f $(which java)

#####
-- 7. Hadoop! (all in each VM)
    Download Hadoop:
        sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz

    Extract and move to /opt/hadoop
    sudo tar -xvzf hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz -C /opt/
    sudo mv /opt/hadoop-3.3.6 /opt/hadoop

    Define env variables:
    export HADOOP_HOME=/opt/hadoop
    export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/sbin:$PATH

    apply:
    source ~/.bashrc

    Verify Java path:
    which java

    Access the hadoop-env.sh file 
    sudo nano /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
    and add this line:
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
    export HADOOP_SSH_OPTS="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null"
    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=gabriel #### Your username

    apply:
    source /opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh

    On master node, start Hadoop!
        start-dfs.sh
        start-yarn.sh

    When you execute this...
        jps
    ...must return something like this:
        5802 NameNode
        4101 ResourceManager
        8901 SecondaryNameNode
        6782 DataNode
        4503 NodeManager

    Install net-tools:
        sudo apt install net-tools

    List all hadoop-master open ports:
        netstat -tulnp | grep LISTEN

    Now you can validate in your browser that Hadoop is online, in your browser.
    Namenode:
        http://{hadoop-master-ip}:9870
    YARN:
        http://{hadoop-master-ip}:8088
    
    In my case:
    http://192.168.64.6:9870/
    http://192.168.64.6:8088/
